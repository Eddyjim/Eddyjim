#sfAjaxAdminDoctrineThemePlugin#

sfAjaxAdminDoctrineThemePlugin is a symfony plugin to ajaxify the symfony admin generator.

With this plugin, your admin pages will be automatically converted to use AJAX for all user gestures, greatly improving the interactivity and "feel" of your application.

Each admin page is loaded once, and from that point, all admin actions are handled as AJAX requests which return JSON-encoded page sections which are used to update the various sections of the page.

The AJAX/JSON approach results in a much snappier user interface because user gestures do not result in page reloads.  As a result, the application feels more like a desktop application, resulting in greater user satisfaction.

This plugin was developed using the default admin theme as a starting point.

Developed on/for symfony 1.4.1 with Doctrine ORM.

## Installation ##
  * Add the jQuery library from http://jquery.com under the web folder.  Add it to your view.yml.

  * Install the plugin.
      Using symfony command line:
          ./symfony plugin:install sfAjaxAdminDoctrineThemePlugin
      Or get the latest version from the subversion repository:
          svn co http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/sfAjaxAdminDoctrineThemePlugin plugins/sfAjaxAdminDoctrineThemePlugin

  * If you installed by subversion, activate the plugin in the config/ProjectConfiguration.class.php file (this will have already been done automatically if you used the plugin:install symfony command).

        [php]
        class ProjectConfiguration extends sfProjectConfiguration
        {
          public function setup()
          {
            ...
            $this->enablePlugins('sfAjaxAdminDoctrineThemePlugin');
            ...
          }
        }

  * Clear your cache

        $ ./symfony cc

  * Publish the plugin assets:

        ./symfony plugin:publish-assets

## How to use ##
  * Generate an admin generator, for example:

        ./symfony --theme=ajaxadmindoctrine doctrine:generate-admin frontend Product --module=product

  * If you already have an admin generated, you can simply change the theme inside your generator.yml, then clear your cache.

        theme: ajaxadmindoctrine


  * Position the AJAX spinner component.  Add something like this to your CSS file:
        #sf_ajax_spinner {
            display: block;
            position: absolute;
            top: 45px;
            right: 8px;
        }
